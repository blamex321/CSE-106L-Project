# Event reminder python

This project is a part of the CSE-106L course.

This project is designed and implemented to
inform the user about any reminder, be it a
person’s birthday or anniversary. The
application sends a reminder through a
desktop notification.

## Introduction

As we all are quite busy with the hustle
and bustle of our daily lives, it is beyond
any doubt that we ought to forget some
things. Be it a birthday of someone
close, or an anniversary. We are bound
forget stuff once in a while.
The main purpose of developing this project is to help people track even the
smallest events and remind the user about the event, just in case they forget.

We have developed this project by using ‘plyer’
and ‘threading’ libraries and some modules in
those libraries.
Plyer library: - This module is used to access
the Hardware features of the system. This is
an external module and needs to be installed in
the client system before execution of the
program.
Notification class: class called notification,
which helps us create a notification.

Threading library: Threading in python is used
to run multiple threads (tasks, function calls) at
the same time.
Time module: - This is an inbuilt Python
module that allows the developer to work with
time. It allows functionalities such as getting
the current time, pausing the program from
executing, etc.
